Rural Community Solutions (RCS) is a passionate and action-oriented nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming lives in Rwanda's rural areas. Founded by a visionary alumna of Gashora Girls Academy, RCS is committed to bridging gaps in literacy and agriculture.
We believe that access to education and food security are the cornerstones of empowering communities. By building libraries in rural areas and supporting agricultural innovations, we aim to unlock the potential of children and their families, creating opportunities for learning, growth, and sustainable livelihoods.
At RCS, our mission is to nurture a well-read and well-fed Rwanda, fostering hope and resilience across rural communities.

<h2>Where We Are</h2>
RCS operates in Rwanda, a vibrant and resourceful country in East-Central Africa. With a population of around 14 million people, the majority—over 80%—live in rural areas. While the capital city, Kigali, boasts most of the country’s public libraries and resources, rural communities face significant challenges in accessing education materials and modern agricultural support.
Our work is centered in these underserved rural regions, where we strive to build libraries, provide access to books and learning materials, and promote agricultural advancements to empower communities. By focusing on these areas, RCS aims to address the gaps in literacy and food security, making a lasting impact on the lives of children and families.

<h2>How We Do It</h2>
We take a hands-on approach to empowering rural communities in Rwanda. Our work is driven by collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to sustainable solutions. Here's how we make a difference:

Building Libraries: We establish libraries in rural areas, bringing books, educational materials, and literacy resources directly to communities where they are needed most.

Promoting Literacy: Through partnerships with schools and community organizations, we provide children and adults with the tools to develop reading and writing skills, fostering a culture of lifelong learning.

Revolutionizing Agriculture: We work with farmers to introduce modern agricultural techniques, improve crop yields, and increase incomes, tackling food insecurity and improving overall well-being.
Engaging Communities: We collaborate with local leaders, educators, and families to ensure that our programs address the unique challenges and aspirations of each community.


<h2>What We Do</h2>

RCS’s mission is to empower rural communities in Rwanda through providing access to literacy
and education through libraries, bridging the educational gap, and bringing knowledge to the
heart of rural Rwanda.

With 83% of the population living in rural areas, access to reading and other educational
materials remains a challenge for kids and adults alike in the rural communities. RCS is
committed to providing opportunities and bridge the knowledge access gap to make a change to
the underserved rural communities. We believe that education has the power to transform lives,
break cycles of poverty, and create a brighter future for generations to come. Therefore, our goal
is to build at least 1 library in each of 30 districts(states) of Rwanda. This will provide
opportunities for kids to have access to books, computers, tutoring and other educational
materials after school. Since some households do not have access to electricity, these libraries
will be a place with electric lights where kids can do their homework after school.

Our first library, Inzozi z’Abato (Little Ones’ Dreams) Library, is built in Sangaza, sector
Ngoma District, eastern province of Rwanda. This is the first library not just in Sangaza sector
but in the whole Ngoma district (this district has 14 sectors). The library is close to a local school
with more than 700 students with limited to no academic resources. The goal is to provide library
services and access to educational materials to the local kids both in school and not in school and
hopefully make some impact in other sectors in Ngoma district.

The vision of the library is to be more than just a building with books; we want it to be a
dynamic learning center, where kids can explore their interests, engage in intellectual
discussions, spark creativity, and get inspired.
