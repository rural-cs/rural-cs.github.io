<h2>Our Mission</h2>
In a country where there are only five libraries in the country and more than 83% of the population living in rural areas, access to reading and other educational materials remains a challenge for kids and adults alike. RCS is committed to providing opportunities and bridge the education access gap to make a change to underserved rural communities. We believe that education has the power to transform lives, break cycles of poverty, and create a brighter future for generations to come.
Our goal is to build at least one library in each of 30 districts(states) of Rwanda. This will provide opportunities for kids to have access to books, computers, tutoring and other educational materials after school. Since some households do not have access to electricity, these libraries will be a place with electric lights where kids can do their homework after school.

<h2>Sangaza Library</h2>
We have built our first library in Sangaza, sector Ngoma District, eastern province of Rwanda. This is the first library not just in Sangaza sector but in the whole Ngoma district (this district has 14 sectors). The library is close to a local school with more than 700 students with limited to no academic resources. The goal is to provide library services and access to educational materials to the local kids both in school and not in school and hopefully make some impact in other sectors in Ngoma district.
We envision these libraries to be more than just buildings with books; we want them to be dynamic learning centers, where individuals can explore their interests, engage in intellectual discussions, spark creativity, and get inspired.
 join us on this incredible journey of making education accessible for all, bridging the educational gap, and bringing knowledge to the heart of rural Rwanda.
