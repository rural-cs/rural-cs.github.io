<h2>Partnering with SACCP LTD</h2>
<p>(Sustainable Agriculture Community Partnership Program)
Together we provide farmers with free trainings and exposure to different methods of farming at our demonstration farm in Kigali City, Rwanda. We share a mission of “showing, not telling,” and an understanding that we have as much to learn from our community as we have knowledge to share.
Our partnership with SACCP allows our farmers access to a “live classroom” where they can learn from an entirely Rwandan (with one exception) staff with over 70 years of collective experience in sustainable agriculture.
RCS believes that food security and enhanced incomes in rural Rwanda  depend on improved farming methods and yields. We understand that not every farmer can afford to experiment or expand through costly processes of trial and error — and we are grateful to have a space where we can safely take risks so others don’t have to on our journey of bringing the most effective farming methods to our community. </p>

<h2>Working with Maize</h2>
<p>As a staple crop in Rwanda, maize production is incredibly important for food security in the country. Rwanda has a climate perfect for growing maize — yet, as of 2023, Rwanda imported $9.57M in corn, according to OEC.
With the proper farming methods, Rwanda has the potential of averaging 5 tons of corn per acre, versus what it currently averages: merely .5 tons of corn per acre. This adjustment would save the country millions in imports, freeing up resources to support development in other areas of the country. 
RCS is committed to bringing more effective methods of growing & harvesting maize to Rwanda in hopes of moving the country closer to food sovereignty.</p>

<h2>A Success Story</h2>

<p>In 2023, a group of farmer’s touring our SACCP demonstration farm in Kigali City expressed interest in improving maize yield. Even though they lived outside of the city, they made frequent trips to the farm and received remote classroom training over the phone. As with most farmers, especially those whose families depend on the success of their harvests, they were reluctant in the beginning to change their practices. But eventually, they felt confident enough in what they had seen and learned with RCS to try the methods for themselves.
After their first harvest, one shared with us: “I have spent my whole life farming, and this is the best crop I have ever had.” </p>

<h2>Our Farmers</h2>

<p>Weekly, RCS meets on Zoom with five Rwandan farmers in our ____ program to share agricultural trainings and toolkits. These meetings are led by RCS founder Sarah Benamina, who is currently getting a Masters in Agricultural Development** at the University of Manoa on Oahu.
